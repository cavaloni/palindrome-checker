# React/TypeScript Palindrome checker

Uses create-react-app with typescript for speedy development and avoiding overhead of webpack configuration.


### Starting server
`yarn start`

This will automatically open a tab in your browser pointed to localhost:3000


## Notes

__Important!__
Tests were not written due to time constraints alone. I would not actually push untested code to be reviewed (in most cases).

Also important to note is that the structure utilizes Reacts new "hooks", which replaces the usage of classes and reduces complexity of lifecycle methods. See more at <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>

#### Dev dependency notes
I personally like to use Prettier to reduce the arguments about code style. You can learn more here: <prettier.io>

TSLint is also initalized to help with standard syntax errors and the like.
